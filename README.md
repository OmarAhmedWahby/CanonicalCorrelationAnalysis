# üìä Superstore Sales - Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) Project

## üßæ Overview

This analysis is based on the **Superstore Sales** dataset, which includes various sales transactions from a retail store.

The dataset contains key features such as:
- Product categories
- Sales amounts
- Profits
- Discounts
- Quantities
- Shipping modes
- Regions

> üéØ **Goal:** Extract meaningful statistical insights to help improve business performance, with a particular focus on increasing **sales** and **profits**.

## üî¨ Statistical Methods Applied

As part of this multivariate analysis project, the following statistical and inferential methods were applied:

1. **Measures of Central Tendency**
   - Mean, Median, Mode of key variables (e.g., Sales, Profit, Discount)
  
2. **Covariance Matrix**
   - To explore relationships and variability between numerical features

3. **Correlation Matrix**
   - To analyze linear relationships and strength/direction between variables

4. **One Variance Test** *(Sales)*
   - To test the homogeneity of variance for sales across a defined group

5. **Two Variances Test** *(Regions)*
   - To compare variance in sales or profit between different regional groups

6. **Multivariate Normality Test**
   - To assess if the dataset meets assumptions for multivariate analysis

7. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**
   - To explore relationships between two sets of variables (e.g., Sales metrics vs. Regional attributes)

8. **Canonical Correspondence Analysis**
   - An extension used to visualize the association between categorical and continuous variables in context

## üìå Notes

- The dataset was cleaned and prepared using basic data wrangling.
- All tests and visualizations were run inside Jupyter Notebook using Python.
- Libraries used include: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, and `sklearn`.
